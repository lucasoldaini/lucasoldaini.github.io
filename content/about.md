Hello ðŸ‘‹ My name is Luca Soldaini ([he/him](https://pronoun.is/he/him)) and I am applied scientist at [Amazon Alexa Search][1] in [Manhattan Beach, California][2].
My research efforts are currently focused on building ranking and generative models for natural language understanding tasks, such as open-domain question answering.

I obtained a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Florence][3] in Italy, and I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Georgetown University][4].
During my doctoral studies, I investigated natural language processing techniques to improve access to medical literature for both medical professionals and lay people.

When not in front of a screen, I enjoys running, geeking out about public transportation systems, and stocking an ever-growing collection of stickers and pins.
